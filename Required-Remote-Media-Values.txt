Required Remote Media Values:
=============================================================
   [enclosureURL]
   [enclosureLength]

Highly Suggested Remote Media Values:
=============================================================
   [enclosureFileType]
   [duration] Otherwise 00:00:00 is used
   [title] Appearance. Otherwise text file name is used and clocking will point
           to the media file
   [pubDate] So the text file can be moved around without causing a re-publish
           of the date

Suggested Remote Media Values:
=============================================================
   [link] A web page, a home page, episode page
   [artist]
   [album]
   [author]
   [summary]
   [keywords]
   [subtitle]

   One, but not both of these values should be used:
=============================================================
   [commentText] Text, no HTML
   [commentCDATA] Text or valid HTML

   For an image file if $imageItemTAG in conf_inc.php is = 'yes'
   Can be done in [commentCDATA] with a valid HTML <image> tag
   This causes the Feed Validator to give an error, even though
   RSS and iTunes documentation says it is OK.

   [allowItemImage]
   [imageURL]
   [imageTitle]
   [imageFileType]

Most likely not needed, one is generated with isPermaLink = false
==================================================================
   [guid]
